C# Stored Proc Query Generator

This project is some skeleton code for a way to generate a qeury containing many stored procedure calls that may have interrelated values.  

This is a work in progress.  So far just the query string is built, the actual SqlCommand with parameters is not constructed.  If anyone finds this useful, please tell me and I will go back and make it work!
